🎯 What drives me:  
The satisfaction of seeing a confusing problem slowly turn into something understandable.

🔭 Lately:  
Strengthening my Java and Spring Boot fundamentals and practicing problem-solving consistently.

💭 Exploring:  
How better structure and small design decisions lead to more maintainable systems.

💡 I like:  
Clean logic, readable code, and understanding the “why” behind things.

✨ A small thing about me:  
I often learn the most when something doesn’t make sense at first.

💬 Ask me about:  
Java, problem-solving approaches, Spring Boot fundamentals, and what I’ve learned so far while working with React and Python.
